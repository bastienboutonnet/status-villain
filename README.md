# status-villain

A CLI clone of [Status Hero](https://statushero.com) for Engineers and terminal nerds.

We're building this live on stream on Twitch every Thursday evening after dinner Amsterdam time!

The tooll will consist of a docker container runing a postgres database to be self hosted (either locally for testing or remotely for usage by teams) and a python client/package to be installed locally.

## How to run

More to come soon probably first in CONTRIBUTING.md
